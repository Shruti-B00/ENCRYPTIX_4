# Spam SMS Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for detecting spam SMS messages using machine learning techniques. The project employs natural language processing (NLP) methods such as TF-IDF for feature extraction and classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines for classification.

It also includes model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and classification reports to ensure robust performance.
